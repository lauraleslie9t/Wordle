# Wordle
Just a fun little project. 

In the console you can write a 5 letter word. Your word will be analysed and each letter will be assigned a colour. 
Green - letter is in the word in the correct place.
Yellow - letter is in the word but the wrong position. 
Gray - letter is not in the word.

The highest tier colour will be represented in the a-z info bar after each guess so you can keep tabs on all letters. You can also play again rather than wait 24H. Have fun if you want to give it a try.
